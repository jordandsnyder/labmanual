# About the Lab 

## Mission

The Lab seeks to serve, empower, and equip individuals and communities to answer their questions, meet their objectives, and transform their lives and communities using community-based mixed methods psychological research. We are particularly interested in working with communities traditionally underserved by clinical psychology, and in particular folks and communities affected by conflict, broadly construed. Wherever we work, we strive to do our work with integrity,  humility, and in the context of authentic relationships.

## Vision

We seek to partner with communities and work towards community health and wellness in the world, one community at a time.

## Core Values

These are values that guide and direct our work on a daily basis. By working in the lab, we all agree to work towards these values.

- Humility: We seek to be open to learning new things through trying out and making mistakes. We will own up to mistakes, and learn from them.

- Curiosity: We approach situations as opportunities to learn something new.

- Integrity: We say what we mean, and mean what we say. We do what we say we will do, and admit when we have made mistakes.

- Relationships: We work towards forming authentic relationships with each other and community partners.

- Persistence: We try, try, and try again.

- Service: We look to the interests of others, including fellow labmates, community partners, and research participants.

- Diversity: We all have different backgrounds and experiences. Through this diversity, we can all learn and get a better perspective. 


## The Communities with whom we partner

While open to working with a diverse range of communities, we have traditionally worked to improve wellness in conflict-affected populations. Specifically, we have partnered with the following organizations:

- [Christian Action for Reconciliation and Social Assistance (CARSA)](https://www.carsaministry.org/) - a nonprofit organization in Rwanda working to heal communities in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

- [Working Alongside Refugees in Mental Health (WARM)](warmalska.org) - a network of mental health providers and allied organizations working to train mental health providers to work with forced migrants, like refugees and asylum-seekers.

## Our Collaborators

Another crucial part of work are those with whom we collaborate. We believe that science is better (and more enjoyable) when done with partners. Below are a couple of our collaborators:

- [Sara Buckingham, Ph.D.](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/academics/college-of-arts-and-sciences/departments/psychology/faculty/buckingham.cshtml), and the [Crossroads Research Collective](https://crossroadsresearch.wixsite.com/collective)

- [Ezer Kang, Ph.D.](https://profiles.howard.edu/profile/466/ezer-kang), and the [Global Community Health Lab](https://ezerkang-howard-faculty.com/)

## Joining the Lab

To join the lab, there is a multi-step process. 

1. Send Jordan a lab application. A lab application consists of sending Jordan an email (snyderj@uwp.edu) with the following: Once the lab application has been filled out, an email will be sent to Jordan. Please note, there are several ways to join the lab:
  + Join the lab as a volunteer. If you join the lab as a volunteer, you will not get compensated or get academic credit for participating in lab. I ask students who volunteer in lab not to do more than 5 hours of lab work per week (inclusive of all meetings).

  + Join the lab for credit. If you join the lab for credit (and Jordan approves this), you will work on a form with Jordan to submit to the registrar. The form will contain a list of obligations/responsibilities for you to complete for a grade. You will get credit for [PSYC499](https://www.uwp.edu/learn/academiccatalog/2019-2021/psyc.cfm#courses#courses). You can get up to 6 credits of PSYC499, with 3 credits counting for upper level electives in the psychology major, and 3 credits counting for upper level electives. If you wish to use 6 credits, I ask that you commit to a full year in the lab (September - May) and use 3 credits per semester. I ask students to expect to work a maximum of 3 hours per week per credit hour (e.g., for 3 credits, you could work up to 9 hours in lab responsibilities per week). However, I don't want you working more than that outside special occasions (e.g., traveling to a conference, etc.).

  + Join the lab as through [the Undergraduate Research Assistantship Program (URAP)](#URAP).

2. Jordan will review these applications on a weekly basis and reach out if he has capacity/availability for a student to schedule an interview. Based upon the application and the interview, he may extend an invitation to join the lab.

3. If you join the lab, you will be expected to do the following:

4. Jordan will do the following:
  + Add you to the lab sharepoint
