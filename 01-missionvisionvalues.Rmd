## The Communities We Partner with

While open to working with a diverse range of communities, we have traditionally worked to improve wellness in conflict-affected populations. Specifically, we have worked with community-based organizations in Rwanda [(CARSA)](https://www.carsaministry.org/) working to heal communities in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, understand the impact of conflict on communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, work towards empowering mental health providers to work with refugees and asylum-seekers in Alaska.
