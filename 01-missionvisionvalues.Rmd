# About the Lab 

## Mission

The Lab seeks to serve, empower, and equip individuals and communities to answer their questions, meet their objectives, and transform their lives and communities using community-based mixed methods psychological research. We are particularly interested in working with communities traditionally underserved by clinical psychology, and in particular folks affected by conflict. Wherever we work, we strive to do our work with integrity,  humility, and built upon authentic relationships.

## Vision

We seek to work towards community health and wellness in the world, one community at a time.

## Core Values

These are values that guide and direct our work on a daily basis. By working in the lab, we all agree to work towards these values.

- Humility: We seek to be open to learning new things through trying out and making mistakes. We will own up to mistakes, and learn from them.

- Curiosity: We approach situations as opportunities to learn something new.

- Integrity: We say what we mean, and mean what we say.

- Relationships: We work towards forming authentic relationships with each other and community partners.

- Persistence: We try, try, and try again.

- Service: We look to the interests of others, including fellow labmates, community partners, and research participants.


## The Communities with whom we partner

While open to working with a diverse range of communities, we have traditionally worked to improve wellness in conflict-affected populations. Specifically, we have partnered with the following organizations:

- [Christian Action for Reconciliation and Social Assistance (CARSA)](https://www.carsaministry.org/) - a nonprofit organization in Rwanda working to heal communities in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

- [Working Alongside Refugees in Mental Health (WARM)](warmalska.org) - a network of mental health providers and allied organizations working to train mental health providers to work with forced migrants, like refugees and asylum-seekers.

## Our Collaborators

Another crucial part of work are those with whom we collaborate. We believe that science is better (and more enjoyable) when done with partners. Below are a couple of our collaborators

- [Sara Buckingham, Ph.D.](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/academics/college-of-arts-and-sciences/departments/psychology/faculty/buckingham.cshtml), and the [Crossroads Research Collective](https://crossroadsresearch.wixsite.com/collective)
