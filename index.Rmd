# Welcome! {-}
Welcome to the Global Community Wellness Lab at the University of Wisconsin, Parkside! If you are reading our lab manual because you recently joined the lab, welcome! If you are a current member of the lab, frequently refer to our lab manual to refresh our guidelines, policies, platforms, among others. We also look forward to learning and researching together. We also welcome you to read this manual if you are looking for tips and tricks for your own manual.
 
Itâ€™s also a work in progress; therefore, updates are implemented as we move forward. If you have ideas about things to add, or what to clarify, feel free to talk to the primary investigator (PI; Dr. Jordan Snyder).
 
No Name lab members are expected to read this manual and sign a form within your first 7 days in the lab indicating you have done so. Signing this form confirms that the lab member will perform their duties and meet the expectations according to this manual.

Before the actual lab manual, we have some people to thank. These include folks who have made their lab manual accessible and members of the lab who have provided feedback based upon the lab manual. Some of the sections are taken directly from these sources, and all of them have provided inspiration on aspects to include in this manual.

Specifically, we thank the following for making their lab manuals accessible:

- [Dr. Aly's Aly Lab Manual](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual/blob/master/aly-lab-manual.pdf), who was also kind enough to write up an article about the lab manual [@aly2018key]

- [Dr. Schleider's Lab Manual for the Lab for Scalable Mental Health](https://osf.io/pwnsm/)

- [Dr. Treichler's Collab Lab Manual](https://www.thecollablab.org/)

- [Dr. Burke's Inergroup Bias Lab Manual](http://www.saraemilyburke.com/IntergroupBiasLabManual.pdf)

- [Dr. Rivera-Mariani's RIPLRT Lab Manual](https://bookdown.org/friveram/labmanualriplrt/)

## About this Lab Manual

We use a lab manual for a few reasons. First, it makes certain things explicit, including things like expectations, so that we don't have to guess. Second, it removes the informal passing on of critical information; with this information and the appropriate information in the [lab sharepoint](https://rangersuwp.sharepoint.com/sites/NoNameLab) as well as the Canvas page, you should have everything to get caught up to reasonable speed. If you do find something that you think is necessary, but not in here, talk with Jordan or the lab manager about getting this added.

Jordan will likely revise this lab manual on a semester basis, and as issues come up.

**Welcome to the Lab!**
