# Lab Resources

## Sharepoint

The lab sharepoint is one of the primary ways that we facilitate information. This website will also host the lab wiki. There is a planner tool that will be used to assign work to folks.

## Canvas

We also have a canvas page that may host some information.

## Qualtrics

This is how we will host surveys. Login information and design is available as needed.

## The Lab Space

Our lab is found in MOLN315E. Jordan will give you information on how to login. 

## Funding

Funding for this lab comes from:

- Jordan's startup funds
- UWP College of Natural and Health Sciences

### The Undergraduate Research Assistantship Program (URAP) {#URAP}

The [Undergraduate Research Assistanship Program (URAP)](https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/researchadmin/urap.cfm) program provides modest stipends for conducting research with a professor. Amounts include \$500 for either the fall or spring semester, and a \$2000 stipend for the summer. Usually, it is best for students to already be involved in the lab to apply for this funding, as it involves a substantial process. If you are interested in applying for URAP, please reach out to Jordan at least **2 months** before the due date.

  App Due Date      Semester of Work      Stipend
----------------  --------------------  -----------
    April                Fall              $500
    January              Spring            $500
    March                Summer            $2,000

If you join the lab with URAP funding, you will be required to submit a report of what you did during your time in the lab. I recommend you keep a journal of tasks and activities that you did during the lab to make this process easier.
