# Expectations and Responsiblities

## Expectations of Everyone {#everyone}

### Big Picture

- Do work that impacts folks and communities, and increases their wellness.

- Do work that makes you proud; make sure the work you do is the highest-quality work you can do. Don't rush. Double-check things. Don't make careless mistakes.

- Remember that you are human; you will make mistakes, and this is okay. If you make a mistake, tell someone early and often. The earlier we can catch a mistake, the easier it is to correct. Jordan has made many mistakes (and will make more mistakes in the future), but please speak up!

- Related to the University of Wisconsin, Parkside's policies on academic integrity ([Policy 28](https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/governance/policy28.cfm),[Policy 35](https://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/governance/policy35.cfm)), maintain integrity in doing scholastic and scientific work. Do not plagiarize, make up data, or alter results. The consequences of doing these can significant. If you have questions about this, talk to someone, including Jordan.

- Support your lab-mates. Help them if needed, even if it is a different project. We all do better when we support each other.

- Respect your lab-mates. Respect their strengths, their developing skills, and their culture, religion, beliefs, and identity.

- If you are struggling, talk with someone! Feel free to talk with Jordan. Your health and wellness is the 1st priority. We look out for each other and understand that life can be difficult. Please feel free to ask for help, or just to talk through things. If you find yourself struggling with anything in lab, please tell Jordan, he values you more than the project that you are on. 

- If there is tension or hostility within the lab, we need to address this. Disrespect and rudeness is not acceptable. If you don't feel comfortable addressing the issue with the responsible party, talk with Jordan (even if you feel okay talking with the responsible party, it is still good to tell Jordan).

- If you have an issue with Jordan, please talk to him about it. If you are not comfortable talking with Jordan, I encourage you to follow up with the department chair (currently Dr. Gregg). She can offer guidance and, if appropriate, intervene on your behalf.

- Outside of lab, please enjoy your life. Jordan would love to hear about cool things you are doing, what you are watching or reading, good places to eat, and where you are traveling to. Jordan believes that life is more than just work, and will lead by example (and share this with you). Jordan doesn't expect students to share about their life unless they want to, however.

### Small Picture (every day)

- If you are sick, please stay home. Reschedule meetings, and you can work remotely if up against a deadline.

- Please keep the lab space clean and tidy. Please clean up after yourself. Please be respectful of the equipment in the lab space.

- Show up to your meetings, your lab hours, interviews/running participants or stakeholders, and lab meetings. Do what you say you will do (i.e., do what you have committed to doing and be dependable).

- Dress code is casual. There are a couple exceptions including working in communities/conducting interviews (in which case, talk with Jordan) and presenting information (professional attire, talk with Jordan about this).

- Lock the lab once you leave it. Turn off any lights/air conditioners if you are leaving. 

- Please be responsive to communication. When lab is in session (September to December; February to May), I expect email responses in 24-48 hours during the work week (Monday-Friday).

- Work when you want, but keep track of the time you work so as to not exceed what your role entails. If you find yourself working over the hours prescribed for your role, please talk with Jordan. I don't expect you to work on weekends or late into the night. If this is continually happening, please talk with me. 

## Expectations of Jordan

Jordan will do everything in the [everyone section](#everyone) and the following:

- Provide supportive, thoughtful, and individually-tailored guidance that is appropriate for your training level. 

- Prioritize your growth as a scientist. Jordan will do his best to support, guide, and collaborate on your work without micromanaging it. It is on you to see ideas through to completion. 

- Provide feedback on scientific products (abstracts, papers, pre-registrations, etc.). I will try to do this within a week, unless I have other commitments. I will let you know if this is the case.
